This insight lets you compare and characterize segments of users.

When no segments are selected this insight shows the top events and
properties for all users. This default state offers a good overview of
the most prominent features in the data as well as the overall
behavior of all users.

With one user segment selected, this insight highlights the events and
properties that make users in that segment different from all other
users. With two segments selected, this insight shows the features
that set users in those segments apart. Features are always sorted
from the most to the least distinctive.

**Example:** See what sets *Most active* and *Least active* users
apart by creating both segments from
[Activity Distribution](/explore/bitdeli/activity-distribution).
