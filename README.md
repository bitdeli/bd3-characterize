This insight lets you compare and characterize segments of users by
showing events and properties typical to a segment of users. The
results depend on how many segments are selected:

* **No segments selected**: an overview of the most frequent events
  and most prominent features in the data
* **One segment selected**: events and properties that make users in
  the selected segment different from all other users
* **Two segments selected**: events and properties that set users in
  the selected segments apart
